* Set the Umask So That New Files Are Only Readable and Writeable by the Owner

### [Simplification:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/umask-command-in-linux-with-examples)

Let’s understand the above table with an example: Let’s explain the previous output we got using umask, 0002

- For a better understanding of the above table, it might seem confusing at first, but it’s pretty simple, all you have to remember is the three modes, **rwx** (read-write-execute).
- The bit for the respective mode, i.e. in 3-bit number, the first bit(leftmost) is for read, then write and execute respectively. In the above example, 0002 is outputted by the umask command, we will be not worrying about the first 0 as of now. the next three digits are 0 0 2.
- Each digit here is for different classes of users, there are a total of 3 classes of users in Linux,
    -   The owner
    -   group members
    -   everyone else
- The above output (0 0 2) shows that the access to the owner is 0, access to the group members is 0, and access to everyone is 2. This 2 is an octal value, to understand the access permissions, we would have to convert it to decimal, 2 is equal to 010 in binary, which can be clarified into 0 for read, 1 for write, and 0 for execute.
- So we can conclude that the above output says – only write permissions for everyone.
