## To list/search or find packages.

* #### dpkg --list: It lists installed packages.

`dpkg --list | head -10`

*Note: `head -10` is used because the output is quite big and head -10 will show first 10 lines/entries.

* #### apt search: It will display available packages which may or may-not be installed.

`apt search <package-name>`
